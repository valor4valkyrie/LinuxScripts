# Linux Scripts

<B><i>Scripts to easily update, clean, reboot or shutdown Linux based operating systems.</i></B>

<p>
Each script runs an update, upgrade and a clean of Linux/Debian based packages. Each script name
ends with the final process so 'Update.sh' just updates the system without a follow up process. While
'UpdateShutdown.sh' ends with the computer shutting itself down.
